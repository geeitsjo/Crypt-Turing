# Crypt-Turing
A game for Alan Turing

I made a game that focused on educating the users about the computer language, Binary.
The game mechanic for the game is communications, the brief was to create a game that would allow the users to communicate and work as a 
team. I created this game because of my passion for computers and also very inspired by the game battleship and the movie Imitation Game. 
I am Alan Turingâ€™s fan, I believe he was a great hero, hence why the title of the game is called Crypt-Turing as the users have to decode 
the coordinates of the enemy and in honour of a great cryptologist! 

I used Unity to build the game and use C# for programming.
